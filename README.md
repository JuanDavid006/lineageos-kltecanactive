# lineageos-kltecanactive
Unofficial Lineage OS repository for the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active (kltecanactive). Based from the official variant of this phone (klteactivexx)

This repository was made for a specific variant of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active (SM-G870W), and it might not work with your variant, even if it's the same model. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

There are three variants for the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active:

-SM-G870W (This repo)

-SM-G870F (Official support avaible: https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_samsung_klteactivexx)

-SM-G870A (This one has a locked bootloader so It will probably not even work)

Device tree and vendor blobs included (if you want to build it yourself).
